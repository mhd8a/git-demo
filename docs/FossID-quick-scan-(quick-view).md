Quick View:

The Quick view is available under Tools tab in FossID home page.
The Quick View tool allows us to upload files to be scanned(located on the left side) and run an instantaneous scan. These files are typically the source code or binary files you want to analyze for open source components. This scan is designed to quickly analyze the uploaded files and identify any open source components and their associated licenses. Immediately after, you will be able to see the resulting matches in the lower window. These results typically include a list of identified open source components, along with relevant information such as component names, versions, and license details. Select any of them and inspect the origin on the right hand side window:

Based on the information provided in the right-hand window, you can review the open source component's details and take appropriate actions. This view provides a user-friendly interface that offers quick insights into the analysis results like the license information.
